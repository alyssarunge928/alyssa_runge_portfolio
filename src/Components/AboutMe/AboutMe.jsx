          </p>A storyteller's job is to captivate the audience with eye-catching words and a compelling call to action that sparks interest and engagement.
          Encouraged by a creative writing teacher who praised my talent from the first assignment, I have always had a knack for weaving words into captivating narratives. Friends who have visited psychics have described me as the empath in their lives, with an uncanny accuracy that speaks to my intuitive nature.
          Born in Maui, I was immersed in the island's rich culture from a young age. Growing up in Arizona and working with hospice patients and their families, I evolved my empathy and compassion. These experiences have shaped my strong sense of self and commitment to compassionate service and emotional connection.
          The pandemic prompted reflection and growth, leading me to pursue my passion for writing. Recognizing my strongest skill, I have been diligently working towards becoming a copywriter, ready to craft stories that captivate and inspire.
